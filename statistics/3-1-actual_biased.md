[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

>> According to the data, biased data does not include any child while the actual data consists of 40% of childeren under 18. This is because the biased data counts responses of children who have at least one child in their family.

The actual data has a mean of 1.0242 where the biased data's mean is 2.4037. It is consistent with the previous finding that the number of children tends to be larger in the biased set.
